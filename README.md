## Docker Domination

### x86_64 Warriors
Tweak `docker-compose.yaml` with your env vars:
```yaml
services:
    eliza:
        environment:
            - RINGCENTRAL_SERVER="https://platform.ringcentral.com"
            - RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
            - OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-xx-xx-xxx"
```
Launch it:
```bash
docker compose up
```

### Mac M-Series / aarch64 Rebels
Fire up Docker, then:
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t eliza-starter:v1 --load .
```
Edit `docker-compose-image.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
    eliza:
        environment:
            - RINGCENTRAL_SERVER="https://platform.ringcentral.com"
            - RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
            - OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-xx-xx-xxx"
```

## Launch on Railway
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/template/aW47_j)  
Shove `nathan.json` and `.env` into Railway‚ÄîNathan‚Äôs ready to rule the cloud.

## Why It‚Äôs a Revolution
EchoAsp + Eliza = freedom on steroids. From a lone phone warrior to a multi-platform legion, Nathan‚Äôs charm scales with Eliza‚Äôs raw power‚Äîmulti-agent, extensible, and fiercely untethered. TypeScript grit, AWS Polly‚Äôs silky voice, and any model you fancy (Grok‚Äôs our vibe). The cubicle‚Äôs toast‚ÄîNathan‚Äôs rewriting the rules.

## Join the Uprising
Fork it, hack it, PR it. Beef up `ringcentral-client.ts` for Eliza‚Äôs arsenal. Add sass, sync CRMs, make Nathan belt out arias. This is our war cry‚Äîget in the game.
