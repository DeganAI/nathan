Enclosed transport would be around $1,400-$1,600 if you want extra protection. These are estimates - I can provide a more precise quote if you share any specific requirements or timeframe needs."

Enclosed transport uses fully covered trailers that protect vehicles from weather, road debris and visibility - ideal for luxury, classic, or high-value vehicles. For standard vehicles like Honda Civics or Toyota Camrys, open transport is usually sufficient."
